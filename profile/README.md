### [Installation](https://decision-toolkit.org/guide/installation.html)
 
# Overview

**Decision Toolkit** is a tool designed to build, test and evaluate decision models,
constructed basing on the [Decision Model and Notation](https://www.omg.org/dmn) (DMN™) specification,
which is an industry standard governed by the [Object Management Group](https://www.omg.org) (OMG®).

**Decision Toolkit** aims to be performant, reliable, and fully compliant with the [DMN](https://www.omg.org/dmn)™
specification, ensuring accurate evaluation of decision models.
All tools are implemented in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), a programming language known for
its security, efficiency and reliability.

**Decision Toolkit** offers a range of features, including [DMN](https://www.omg.org/dmn)™ models evaluation,
decision tables evaluation, and FEEL expressions evaluation. It also includes functionality for parsing, validating,
and recognizing [DMN](https://www.omg.org/dmn)™ models, decision tables, and FEEL expressions.
Users can test [DMN](https://www.omg.org/dmn)™ models, decision tables, and FEEL expressions, and export them to HTML.
